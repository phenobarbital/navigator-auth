# Worktree Management

Worktrees isolate **features** from each other: one worktree per feature (or
hotfix); the tasks of a feature run sequentially inside that same worktree.
Branch *policy* (which base each flow type uses, sync-down, `/sdd-done` never
targeting `main`) lives in `CLAUDE.md` § Git Configuration — this file is the
how-to.

## 1. Where they live, how they are named

- Always under `.worktrees/` (git-ignored). Never a global directory.
- Names come from `scripts.sdd.sdd_meta.plan_worktree`, never invented:
  - feature → `feat-<FEAT-ID>-<slug>` (the doubled `feat-FEAT-` prefix is intentional — `/sdd-done` greps on it)
  - hotfix → `hotfix-<JIRA-KEY>-<slug>`
- Base ref is **always `origin/<base_branch>`** — `dev` (or `staging` during a freeze) for features, `main` for hotfixes — never `HEAD`, so a worktree can never inherit an unpushed local commit.

## 2. Create (idempotent)

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m scripts.sdd.ensure_worktree --slug <slug> --feature-id FEAT-<NNN>   # feature → origin/dev
python -m scripts.sdd.ensure_worktree --slug <slug> --jira-key <JIRA-KEY>     # hotfix  → origin/main
```

- Created by whoever implements: `/sdd-start`, `sdd-worker`, and the dev-loop orchestrators (`sdd-planner`, `sdd-research`, `sdd-autopilot`). `/sdd-task` creates none.
- **Never** `claude --worktree` (it branches from `main`, which has no SDD artifacts) and never hand-build `git worktree add` for SDD work.
- Skip the worktree entirely for docs-only changes, single-commit fixes, single-task specs and brainstorms — work on a plain branch.

## 3. Inspect

```bash
git worktree list                         # primary checkout + every worktree
git -C <path> rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD  # branch
git -C <path> status --porcelain           # empty = clean
```

The active worktree is the one whose branch matches the feature at hand; with
several candidates prefer the newest `feat-*` / `hotfix-*` entry. Report
**path, branch, clean / not clean**, and remind: *all feature edits happen
inside `<path>`* — never in the primary checkout.

## 4. Work inside

- Run git as `git -C <path> ...` (or `cd` in). Small commits, one task per commit, and **push early** (`git push -u origin <branch>`): other sessions may merge or `reset --hard` the shared tree, and only pushed commits are safe.
- The shared `.venv` is editable-installed against the **main checkout**, so a bare `pytest` inside a worktree can import the wrong branch's compiled extensions (Cython/Rust). If results look stale, rebuild in the worktree (`python setup.py build_ext --inplace`, `cargo build`) before trusting them. Never `uv sync` inside a worktree — it repoints the shared venv and breaks the main checkout's import for every session once the worktree is removed.
- Run the tests your task names; do not start with a full baseline sweep.

## 5. Finish

- Working tree clean, branch pushed.
- SDD lane: `/sdd-done <FEAT-ID>` verifies the tasks, stamps the index, merges feature → `base_branch` and cleans up.
- Ad-hoc lane: `gh pr create --base <base_branch> --head <branch> --title "..." --body "..."` — never against `main` for a feature. If `gh` is missing or unauthenticated, hand the user the exact commands instead.

## 6. Clean up

```bash
/remove-worktree                          # list first; refuses worktrees with a live sdd-worker
git worktree remove .worktrees/<name>
git worktree prune                        # drop stale admin data
```

Never remove a worktree with uncommitted changes, never `--force` unless the
user explicitly asks, and look for orphan directories under
`.worktrees/` that `git worktree list` no longer knows about —
`/remove-worktree` handles those; `prune` does not.
